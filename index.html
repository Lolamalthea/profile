          <h2>Founder at Amalthea</h2>
          <p>After being an employment lawyer for more than 5 years, I decided to create my own company. Since September 2015, I assist parents who employ their nanny with all the administrative work (employment contract, salary, etc.).</p>
          <p>Today, I want to automatize some of my work by creating a web application for the parents. That's why I'm here!</p>
